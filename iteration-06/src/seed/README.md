# Seeding the database

The majority of **Task 2** is already pre-made from us, so you can focus on writing the seed logic yourself.

Loading an parsing the file is done in the `src/seed/yaml-parse/parse.ts` module

[Data transfer objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) are also pre-made in the `src/types/data-transfer-objects.ts`. Though, they are **not** complete, you need to **finish the type definitions**

The seed script itself is also written, all you need to do to make it work is **finish the function in** `src/seed/dto-to-database/seef-from-dtos.ts`
