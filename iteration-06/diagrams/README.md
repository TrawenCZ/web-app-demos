# ER Diagram

Create the ER diagram of the database. Start the diagram by capturing the Prisma model and extend the diagram as specified in the assignment. Model the [physical diagram](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/support/documents/vpuserguide/3563/3564/85378_conceptual,l.html), so model **ALL** join tables, even if some of the many-to-many relationships are done by Prisma implicitly.
